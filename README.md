# vistamilk_diet_challenge
Code and presentations for the winning MLGIG team entry for the data challenge at the [International Workshop on Spectroscopy and Chemometrics 2022](https://www.vistamilk.ie/event/international-workshop-on-spectroscopy-chemometrics/), 
organised by the Vistamilk SFI Research Centre, Ireland.

This work has also been published in a peer reviewed journal and you can read more details about our team submission and the other teams submissions [Chemometrics journal paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/user/identity/landing?code=WoIm6RKfyzHPgNLvYW8OAVV54MLKjzs4vfB1xsFL&state=retryCounter%3D0%26csrfToken%3D62a50f43-d49e-454a-b54b-6e31f3eaf2e4%26idpPolicy%3Durn%253Acom%253Aelsevier%253Aidp%253Apolicy%253Aproduct%253Ainst_assoc%26returnUrl%3D%252Fscience%252Farticle%252Fpii%252FS0169743923000059%26prompt%3Dnone%26cid%3Darp-7a5b3c61-87a2-459a-9351-7e6680e4a16d)

## Notebooks
For each group of approaches investigated, there is an associated notebook in folder [notebooks](https://github.com/mlgig/vistamilk_diet_challenge/tree/main/notebooks) or in folder [deep_models](https://github.com/mlgig/vistamilk_diet_challenge/tree/main/deep_models).

Have a quick look at the [slides](https://github.com/mlgig/vistamilk_diet_challenge/blob/main/28042022-VistaMilk-DietChallenge-MLGIG-slides.pdf) before divign through the code.
