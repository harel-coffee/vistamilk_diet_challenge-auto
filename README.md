# vistamilk_diet_challenge
Code and presentations for the winning MLGIG team entry for the data challenge at the [International Workshop on Spectroscopy and Chemometrics 2022](https://www.vistamilk.ie/event/international-workshop-on-spectroscopy-chemometrics/), 
organised by the Vistamilk SFI Research Centre, Ireland.

## Notebooks
For each group of approaches investigated, there is an associated notebook in folder [notebooks](https://github.com/mlgig/vistamilk_diet_challenge/tree/main/notebooks) or in folder [deep_models](https://github.com/mlgig/vistamilk_diet_challenge/tree/main/deep_models).
